// ==============================================
// File: LoanService.java
// Role:
//   - This is a service layer **interface** that defines business logic operations related to loan applications.
//   - It separates the business logic from the controller (LoanController).
//
// Why it matters:
//   - It allows the controller to use loan-related functions without worrying about implementation details.
//   - Helps maintain a clean MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.
//   - Promotes testability and scalability.
//
// Dependencies:
//   - MultipartFile (Spring's interface to represent uploaded files)
//   - LoanApplication (custom entity that maps to database table)
//
// Related files:
//   - LoanServiceImpl.java (implements this interface)
//   - LoanController.java (calls methods defined here)
