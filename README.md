Loan Approval System – Project Documentation
1. Project Title
Loan Approval System
2. Overview
The Loan Approval System is a full-stack web application designed to facilitate automated loan requests and eligibility assessment. Users can register and log in securely via JWT-based authentication. After login, users can apply for loans, and the system dynamically evaluates eligibility based on the user’s credit score. An integrated chatbot assists users throughout the process by answering queries and offering guidance.
